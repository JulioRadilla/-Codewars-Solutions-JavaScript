/*Write a function that always returns 5

Sounds easy right? Just bear in mind that you can't use any of the following characters: 0123456789*+-/

Good luck :)*/
//Solution:
function unusualFive() {
    //Use a variable to hold in a string that has 5 characters
    let five = 'Five!';
    //return the length of the string
    return five.length;
}
