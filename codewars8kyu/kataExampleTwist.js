/*This is an easy twist to the example kata (provided by Codewars when learning how to create your own kata).

Add the value "codewars" to the array websites 1,000 times.*/
//Solution:
//Use the new Array syntax and put 1000 so that it returns an array with that length inputed
//Use the fill method on the array created and use the codewars value so it can fill the whole array length created 
var websites = new Array(1000).fill("codewars")
